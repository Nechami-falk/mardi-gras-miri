        <button class="accordion">When does Mardi Gras start and end?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The carnival season always begins on January 6, which is King's Day. Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday), on the
                other
                hand, is a
                different day each year.Tuesday The oil changes every year because Easter Sunday is never the same
                Sunday
                every year.
                Oil Tuesday is always the day before Ash Wednesday.Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the
                Saturday
                before Mardi
                Gras and stay until Ash Wednesday.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Is there Mardi Gras "official"?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do not believe the
                claims of
                businesses that offer "official" merchandise from Mardi Gras or the "official" Mardi Gras website. The
                use
                of the term
                "official" is just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who do not know better.
                Products or
                websites are not licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each single parade is responsible for all
                its
                merchandise.
                In some parts of the state, official organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not
                true in New
                Orleans.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What is the weather usually like during Mardi Gras? What should I pack?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very hot, almost hot. Sometimes this will change
                from one end
                to the other during the same day. It is advisable to lay down the clothes as a cold morning can turn
                into a hot
                afternoon.
                Because you will spend long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that may get a little
                dirty. Do not forget
                to check the forecast for rain. If you forecast storms then you will definitely want to bring a
                raincoat!.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Can I bring my children to Mardi Gras?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>In every way, yes! Contrary to popular belief, Mardi Gras is a family celebration. Those of us who grew
                up in New
                Orleans feel guilty once our kids have grown up and we keep going to every parade because we used to use
                the “take the
                kids” patch! Bring large bags (even large garbage bags!) To hold all the things they will grab.
                Injections often include
                toys, stuffed animals, beads and more.
                It is recommended to take your children to parades in suburban areas like Matayar, which is 10 minutes
                away.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What are the best ways to get around New Orleans after I arrive?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>The best transportation methods will be through taxi / car sharing services, tram or rental car,
                depending on where you
                are staying. Driving your vehicle and finding parking spaces will be difficult.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Why is Mardi Gras set on different dates each year?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Mardi Gras' date changes each year as it is connected to Easter, which can take place every Sunday from
                March 23 to
                April 25. Mardi Gras Day always takes place 47 days before Easter.</p>
